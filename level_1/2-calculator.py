# Challenge: Using the REPL perform arithmetic operations (+, -, /, *)
# NOTE: this requires the use of Micropy REPL (i.e. via Picocom)

# Addition
sum = 5 + 3
print(sum)

# Subtraction
diff = 5 - 3
print(diff)

# Division
quot = 10 / 2
print(quot)

# Multiplication
prod = 5 * 2
print(prod)# NOTE: this requires the use of Micropy REPL (i.e. via Picocom)

# Put some operations together
print(5 + 2 * 3)
